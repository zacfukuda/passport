# Single Page App Authentication in [React.js](https://reactjs.org/)

As a single page application, this app uses JWT, which will be issued at the correct username/password input, to authenticate users. The front-end application relys on React.js and [React Router](https://github.com/ReactTraining/react-router) library.

## Getting started

Run the application as follows:

```bash
# On one window
$ mongod
# or
$ mongod --config /usr/local/etc/mongod.conf

# On another
$ yarn
$ yarn start

# On yet another
$ node server.js 
```
