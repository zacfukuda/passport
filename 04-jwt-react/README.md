# Single Page App Authentication with JWT & React.js


As a single page application, the application issues [JSON Web Token](https://jwt.io/) at the  username/password authentication. The front-end application is built on [React.js](https://reactjs.org/) and [React Router](https://github.com/ReactTraining/react-router) library.
